# Bottled Notes
This project is based on how people create new relationships online. I wanted to design a platform where connections between individuals feel more authentic. A lot of people find it difficult to trust strangers online; this platform is based on anonymity rather than having to convince someone online that you're who you're saying you are. You won't ever know who you're talking to-- you'll only be able to chat with them and see their responses to daily questions.
