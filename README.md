# Bottled Notes
The most "authentic" connections might come from when you're anonymous. A lot of social media has a focus on who a person is, and not what they say. Bottled notes is a platform where the focus is on what people say rather than who they are. 

The target audience is for people seeking spontaneous, random connections online, but may be afraid of using traditional social media to meet new people because a lot of it is connected back to you as a person. On bottled notes, you don't ever have to disclose your identity to anyone.
